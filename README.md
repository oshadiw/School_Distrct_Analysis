# School_District_Analysis
An analysis was done to compare statistics of various high schools in a disctrict. After the analysis was complete, some changes had to be made to the data structure. The following is a summary of the changes in data sets. 
### Challenge
  - District and School Summary changes:
      - The district summary was slightly changed. The average math score decreased by 0.1% and the % passing math, reading and overall scores decreased 1%. 
      - The school summary now has Thomas High School with much lower % passing math, reading and overall students. 
  - High- and Low- Performing schools:
      - Thomas High School is now the 8th top performing school, as opposed to the 2nd top before the changes. 
  - Replacing 9th Grade Results:
      - Since there are no math and reading scores for Thomas High School 9th graders, there is no value in the column. 
      - For the spending range per student that Thomas High School is in ($630-644), the overall passing rate dropped from 63 to 56.
      - For the corresponding school size for Thomas High School (Medium, 1000-2000), the scores for math reading and overall passing all dropped. 
      - Lastly, the scores for the charter schools dropped, since Thomas High School is a charter school.
